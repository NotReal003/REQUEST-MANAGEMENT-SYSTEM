# Request Management System

# PLEASE NOTE
To get this page working, I'll soon release the API source code which can be found [HERE](https://github.com/notreal003/REQUEST_PAGE_API).
## Overview
This project is a fully functional request management system, designed for users to submit various types of requests such as Discord reports, support requests, and guild applications. Administrators can manage these requests with advanced control options. Additionally, the system incorporates a cryptocurrency payment feature, allowing users to support the project using different crypto wallets.

The system utilizes React for the frontend and Node.js with MongoDB for the backend. Features include JWT-based authentication, email notifications, request status updates, and an admin dashboard for managing user requests.
